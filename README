Duke Data Accessioner v. 1.0

**THIS BRANCH IS CURRENTLY UNDER DEVELOPMENT.**

About

The DataAccessioner was built out of the need for a simple GUI interface to allow the Duke University Rare Book, Manuscripts, & Special Collections Library (now the David M. Rubenstein Rare Book & Manuscript Library) Technical Services staff an easy way of migrating data off disks and onto a file server for basic preservation, further appraisal, arrangement, & description. It also provides a way to integrate common metadata tools at the time of migration rather than after the fact. With a simplified interface and being written in Java it is intended to be easily adopted by smaller institutions with little or no IT staff support.

This version (1.0) was developed with the support of the Digital POWRR Project (funded by an Institute of Museum and Library Services National Leadership Grant). The primary change is the exchange of a custom tool-adapter plugin system with FITS integration and primarily relies on XSLT for the former Metadata Manager's role (though future extensibility should be easy, although will need to be hard-coded).
