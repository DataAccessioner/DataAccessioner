Data Accessioner v. 1.1
=======================

About
-----

The DataAccessioner is a simple GUI interface to allow archivists and digital preservationists an intuitive way
to migrate data off disks and onto a file server for basic preservation, further appraisal, arrangement, & description.
It also provides a way to integrate common metadata tools at the time of migration rather than after the fact. With a
simplified interface, written in Java, it is intended to be easily adopted by smaller institutions with little or no
IT staff support.
