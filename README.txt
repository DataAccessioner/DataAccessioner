Data Accessioner v. 1.1

About

The DataAccessioner is a simple GUI interface to allow archivists and digital preservationists an intuitive way to migrate data off disks and onto a file server for basic preservation, further appraisal, arrangement, & description. It also provides a way to integrate common metadata tools at the time of migration rather than after the fact. With a simplified interface, written in Java, it is intended to be easily adopted by smaller institutions with little or no IT staff support.
